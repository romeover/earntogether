# 👋 Hey there!

I'm a developer and testnet operator focused on contributing to the future of decentralized infrastructure. I run high-performance nodes across multiple blockchain networks and actively participate in testnets to help shape and scale the next generation of Web3 protocols.

--- Web3 Infra Architect | ZK Prover | Testnet Operator | Node Automation &amp; Scale |  Dev by heart, node by nature. ZK proofs, bare metal, and testnets at scale  |  Running the backbone of Web3—Testnets, ZK Proofs, Infra That Scales  |  Breaking things to build better infra. Nodes, testnets, and zero-knowledge magic  |

## 🛠️ What I Do

- ⚙️ **Testnet Operator** — Participating in early-stage blockchain and ZK testnets  
- 💻 **Node Runner** — Deploying and managing nodes on both bare metal and cloud environments  
- 🔒 **ZK Proof Enthusiast** — Exploring zero-knowledge proofs, performance tuning, and prover setups  
- ☁️ **Infra Builder** — Working with tools like Docker, systemd, monitoring stacks, and automation  
- 🧪 **Early Contributor** — Providing feedback, bug reports, and benchmarks to protocol teams
